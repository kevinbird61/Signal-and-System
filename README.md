# Signal-and-System
Implementation of Course - [Signal and System]

## Format 
###### "[Date] - [Practice]"
Show the practice after class.
###### "Lab"
Show the homework and some experiment
## Implementaion 
###### Lab1
Implement "Square Wave".
###### Lab2
Implement RC circuit with Lab1.
###### Lab3
Implement Convolution , take a deeper look in lab2.
###### Lab4
Implement the RLC circuit.
###### Lab5 
Implement the Beat frequency.
###### Lab6
Implement the ADSR generator to transform a cosine wave into piano sound.
###### Lab7
Implement PID controller.

1. Why "s" need to be negative? Ans: because if s is positive , the whole system will grow and reach to infinite. And this system comes to become unstable.

2. [P.S.] "s" need to be pass through inverted Laplace transform , the "s" value will become exponential coef.
